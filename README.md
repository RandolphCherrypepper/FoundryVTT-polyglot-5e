# What is it?

Supports speaking/understanding different languages using in-character chat, based on current token's language capabilities. Built for the dnd5e package of FoundryVTT.

# Installation

Use the following as the manifest link:

https://github.com/RandolphCherrypepper/FoundryVTT-polyglot-5e/releases/latest/download/module.json

# How to use it?

When a token is selected, the languages of the associated character will be used to understand languages in the chat log. This rewrites entries as they are rendered. If a new token is chosen, simply collapse/close the chat log and reopen it.

The list of languages to use when speaking are located near the chatbox. The button next to it must be used to send IC text in the given language.

Note: Pushing enter in the chat textbox will use the default in-character submission without respecting the language drop-down box.
